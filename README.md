# Rain Prediction in Australia

In this project, we built a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day.

For this project, we used a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology , cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms on the data.The data can be downloaded [here](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/).

We have used the following algorithms to build our models:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM


The results were reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
